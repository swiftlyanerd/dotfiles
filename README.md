# My Dotfiles
![Terminal screenshot](https://i.imgur.com/QS8lL1a.png)

I've decided to upload my dotfiles here in case I break something and need to reinstall my OS. 

## Dependencies
I've listed all dependencies below. Install those via your preferred installation method, whether that's your distribution's package manager or compiled from source.

### Software
* `vim` - my text editor of choice
* `neofetch` - displays sysinfo in your term window
* `kitty` - my term emulator of choice

### Fonts
* `Terminus (TTF)` - used in terminal

### Other
* `base16-eighties.vim` - vim color scheme by [@chriskempson](https://github.com/chriskempson), which can be found [here](https://github.com/chriskempson/base16-vim).

## Installation
**Disclaimer:** In the off chance that anyone finds this and wants to try out these configs, then do so at your own risk. Be sure to go over and understand what each config file does and don't be surprised if something doesn't work on your system.

### Git
* Clone the repository wherever you want in your system with `git`:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/swiftlyanerd/dotfiles.git
```
* Copy the config files and directories to your `home` directory.
* Install fonts to appropriate folders.

Eventually I'll write a script that does this automatically.

## That's kinda it...
Don't expect anything crazy from this. These files have obviously been customized to my liking, and what I like will most likely not match your preferences. Nonetheless, if you find any inspiration from this or simply like what you see, then enjoy!
